CloudSim: A Framework For Modeling And Simulation Of Cloud Computing Infrastructures And Services

In this repository, I impelemened source code about Min-Min Algorithm which is a kind of scheduling algorithm base on the CloudSim package on Java.

The Min-Min algorithm first estimates tasks' time to establish a queue which is consist of sorted tasks by descending times,
Then it dispatches task where have minimum time to execute.
